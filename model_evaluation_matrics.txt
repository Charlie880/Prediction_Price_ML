3. Comparison and Key Insights

**Classification:**
- Best Performing Model: Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: 91.14%)
- Key Features: age and max_power consistently influence predictions.

**Regression:**
- Best Performing Model: Random Forest Regressor (R² Score: 0.97, MSE: 20,051,987,199.62)
- Key Features: max_power remains the dominant predictor across all models.
  
**Linear Regression:** 
While providing an interpretable baseline, it showed lower performance (R² Score: 0.79) compared to ensemble methods like Random Forest.
