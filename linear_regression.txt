Linear Regression Analysis: Car Price Prediction

Objective
The primary aim of this analysis was to predict car selling prices using a linear regression model, leveraging various features such as mileage, engine capacity, max power, and categorical attributes like seller type, owner type, and transmission type.

Dataset Preparation

Feature Selection
The following features were selected for the model:
- Mileage (km/ltr/kg)
- Engine Capacity
- Max Power
- Age (calculated from the manufacturing year)
- Seller Type (Individual)
- Owner Type (Second Owner)
- Transmission Type (Manual)

Feature Engineering
- An age column was created by subtracting the car's manufacturing year from the current year.
- Categorical features (seller_type, owner, and transmission) were transformed into binary values using one-hot encoding to facilitate model training.

Data Splitting
The dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

Model Performance Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 209,941,047,424.15
- R² Score: 0.68

These metrics indicate that while the model captures a reasonable amount of variance in car prices, there is still room for improvement.

Insights from Feature Importance
The coefficients derived from the linear regression model offer insights into how each feature influences car selling prices:

| Feature                  | Coefficient        | Impact                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| mileage(km/ltr/kg)      | 15,111.28          | Positive contributor to selling price. |
| max_power               | 13,411.96          | Positive contributor to selling price. |
| engine                   | 16.59              | Minimal impact on price.            |
| age                      | -35,835.68         | Older cars tend to have lower selling prices. |
| owner_Second Owner      | -54,554.79         | Cars with multiple owners are valued lower. |
| seller_type_Individual   | -208,823.58        | Cars sold by individuals are priced lower. |
| transmission_Manual      | -479,808.35        | Cars with manual transmission have significantly lower prices. |

Visualizations
1. Feature Importance Visualization
   - A bar plot illustrated that transmission_Manual had the most substantial negative impact on car prices, followed by seller_type_Individual and owner_Second Owner. In contrast, both mileage(km/ltr/kg) and max_power emerged as key positive contributors.

2. Actual vs. Predicted Selling Prices
   - A scatterplot comparing predicted and actual selling prices demonstrated a generally good alignment for most data points; however, it revealed increasing variance at higher price ranges. This suggests that while the model captures general trends effectively, it struggles with outliers or extreme values.

Conclusion
The linear regression model performed reasonably well with an R² score of 0.68, indicating that it explains a significant portion of the variance in car prices but has limitations in addressing higher-priced cars and outliers.

Key predictors of car price include:
- Positive Influencers: Mileage and max power.
- Negative Influencers: Age of the car, seller type (individual), owner type (second owner), and transmission type (manual).
